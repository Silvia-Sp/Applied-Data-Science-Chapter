# Final Project
This final project focuses on predicting whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land.
SpaceX offers launches at around $62 million, compared to over $165 million by other providersâ€”largely due to the ability to reuse the first stage.
Accurately predicting landing success allows for cost forecasting, which can be valuable for alternative companies looking to compete with SpaceX for launch contracts.

Project Objectives
- Analyze Falcon 9 mission data to understand key factors influencing landing success

- Use Python tools (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.) for data processing, analysis, and modeling

- Build machine learning models to predict first stage landing outcomes

- Share results via a Jupyter Notebook and GitHub for transparency and reproducibility
